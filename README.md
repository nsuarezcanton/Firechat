# Firechat
A small chatting application implemented using Swift. It uses the Firechat API to handle messaging, user creation and such. Still needs a fair amount of (work) debugging and styling improvement, but some of the basic functionality is covered. I plan on using this application as the base interface for my capstone project at Union College.
